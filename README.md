# Allow only Cloudflare v2 

Now the system is running on ufw I don't recommend using ipatbles. It works extremely unstable.

What components should I install if they are not installed on the server?

``apt install ufw``

If you restarted the server, you need to reactivate it with the command

``ufw enable``
